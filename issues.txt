* In app/files/views.py, for every login_required view, the @login_reuired
  decorator has been removed, the view function name changed to view_reg,
  and a login_required version is retained with the original view name.
  The view_reg functions do not have configured URLs, and are hence not
  accessible.
* Users after logging in were supposed to be redirected to '/home/'. This URL
  does not exist, so the redirection has been made to '/'
* User who has been authenticated from a registered (unregistered) IP, and
  switches to an unregistered (registered) IP is not required to
  authenticate again, and retains all earlier privileges.
* The login template is now set in the middleware, using the values in
  settings_local.py. This means that any values passed with 'template_name'
  to the login view in urls.py will be overriden.
* Currently, in urls.py
    (r'^admin/(.*)', include(admin.site.urls)),
  is preferred for the admin. site configuration, instead of,
    (r'^admin/(.*)', admin.site.root),
  Please see http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/#hooking-adminsite-instances-into-your-urlconf . With the old style declaration, I am
  forced to use
    reverse(admin.site.root, args=['']) 
  to get the root of the admin. site URL. admin.site.root is deprecated
  and will disappear in Django 1.3. Now, the admin. uses named URLs, so
  that the usage should be
    reverse('admin_index', args=[''])
  However, this will work only with the above changes to urls.py.
* url(r'admin/([^/]+)/([^/]+)/bulk_caption/$', 'files.views.bulk_caption'),
  adds an URL with an admin. prefix to a view that can be seen by a staff
  member (not necessarily an admin.). This is treated as a non-admin URL by
  the IP address-based redirection middleware, i.e., users from registered
  IPs can directly go to this URL even if they are not staff members. To
  prevent this, a special exception can be made for this URL.
* app.files.eps is not protected by @login_required. I am not sure why
  this is the case, and have left it alone.
