The middleware uses the \netaddr~\cite{url:netaddr} library to
manipulate IP addresses. \netaddr was chosen after a careful
examination of available Python IP libraries. The other strong
contender was \ipaddr~\cite{url:ipaddr} which has been accepted
into the standard library for Python versions 2.7 and 3.1
onwards. The final choice of \netaddr was because of better
functionality, more features, and especially the end-user
friendly classes like IPRange class for IPAddress ranges, and the
Wildcard class. We use only a tiny part of the functionality
provided by \netaddr, and a conscious decision was made not to
offer too many configuration options. However, if it is felt to
be desirable, features like wildcards for IP addresses can be
added. The current version of the library in use is 0.6.3.
