This document describes the IP address redirection solution built
for the \client. The solution fulfils a need to have users from a set of
registered IP addresses provided access to non-admin views
without their having to log in. Administrative users from these IP
addresses, namely anyone wishing to view a Django admin. page
will need to log in as usual. For users from any unregistered IP
addresses, the authentication process is as usual for Django,
namely access is allowed if the user is authenticated and has
sufficient permissions for the view in question.

The solution is implemented as Django middleware, also
necessitating some changes to the URLs and views for the Django
project. Chapter~\ref{sec:installation} describes installation
and usage, and should be all that is required for a user of the
middleware. Chapter~\ref{sec:functioning} describes how the users
of the system interact with it. Some technical details are
provided in Chapter~\ref{sec:technical}. Finally, policy
decisions, edge cases, and peculiarities are described in
Chapter~\ref{sec:issues}.
