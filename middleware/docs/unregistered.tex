Users from unregistered IP addresses function as usual with the
Django authentication layer. They need to log in to access any
pages protected with the {\tt \@login\_required} decorator, and
need to have administrative privileges in order to access
admin. views. A different login page, B, is shown to them, using
the {\tt maersk.swf} SWF file.
